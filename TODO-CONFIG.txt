- decide about setting apollo-configuration 'constants' for an application. Lenses?!?
- implement service-specific configuration support
- fix meta tests/implement configuration support in meta + revisit skipped test in ServiceHelper, or wherever
- figure out how to do overrides based on CLI/envvars.
- implement in apollo-standalone, particularly interesting to see how hermes client config will work, with collections
- consider removing the 'run <pod>' command line args - there doesn't seem to be any reason why apollo itself needs args?
- go through all TODO comments in the code
